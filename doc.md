## Does Application Gateway support static IP?
Yes, the Application Gateway v2 SKU supports static public IP addresses and static internal IPs. The v1 SKU supports static internal IPs.

## Can I deploy more than one Application Gateway resource to a single subnet?
Yes. In addition to multiple instances of a given Application Gateway deployment, you can provision another unique Application Gateway resource to an existing subnet that contains a different Application Gateway resource.

A single subnet can't support both v2 and v1 Application Gateway SKUs.

## Can Application Gateway communicate with instances outside of its virtual network or outside of its subscription?
As long as you have IP connectivity, Application Gateway can communicate with instances outside of the virtual network that it's in. Application Gateway can also communicate with instances outside of the subscription it's in. If you plan to use internal IPs as backend pool members, use virtual network peering or Azure VPN Gateway.

## Can I deploy anything else in the application gateway subnet?
No. But you can deploy other application gateways in the subnet.

## How does Application Gateway support high availability and scalability?
The Application Gateway v1 SKU supports high-availability scenarios when you've deployed two or more instances. Azure distributes these instances across update and fault domains to ensure that instances don't all fail at the same time. The v1 SKU supports scalability by adding multiple instances of the same gateway to share the load.

The v2 SKU automatically ensures that new instances are spread across fault domains and update domains. If you choose zone redundancy, the newest instances are also spread across availability zones to offer zonal failure resiliency.

## How do I achieve a DR scenario across datacenters by using Application Gateway?
Use Traffic Manager to distribute traffic across multiple application gateways in different datacenters.

## Does Application Gateway support autoscaling?
Yes, the Application Gateway v2 SKU supports autoscaling. For more information, see Autoscaling and Zone-redundant Application Gateway.

## Does Application Gateway support autoscaling?
Yes, the Application Gateway v2 SKU supports autoscaling. For more information, see Autoscaling and Zone-redundant Application Gateway.

## Can Application Gateway communicate with instances outside of its virtual network or outside of its subscription?
As long as you have IP connectivity, Application Gateway can communicate with instances outside of the virtual network that it's in. Application Gateway can also communicate with instances outside of the subscription it's in. If you plan to use internal IPs as backend pool members, use virtual network peering or Azure VPN Gateway.

## Can I deploy anything else in the application gateway subnet?
No. But you can deploy other application gateways in the subnet.

## Can I simultaneously use Application Gateway for both external and internal traffic?
Yes. Application Gateway supports one internal IP and one external IP per application gate

## Does Application Gateway support virtual network peering?
Yes. Virtual network peering helps load-balance traffic in other virtual networks.

## Can I talk to on-premises servers when they're connected by ExpressRoute or VPN tunnels?
Yes, as long as traffic is allowed.

## How can I stop and start Azure Application Gateway?
You can use Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI to stop and start Azure Application Gateway. When you stop and start Application Gateway, billing also stops and starts.
```bash
# Stop an existing Azure Application Gateway instance
az network application-gateway stop -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAppGateway

# Start an existing Azure Application Gateway instance
az network application-gateway start -g MyResourceGroup -n MyAppGateway
```

## Can a single ingress controller instance manage multiple Application Gateways?
Currently, one instance of Ingress Controller can only be associated to one Application Gateway.

## Can I connect my AKS cluster and Application Gateway in separate virtual networks?
Yes, as long as the virtual networks are peered and they don't have overlapping address spaces. If you're running AKS with kubenet, then be sure to associate the route table generated by AKS to the Application Gateway subnet.

## Multi-cluster / Shared Application Gateway
By default AGIC assumes full ownership of the Application Gateway it is linked to. AGIC version 0.8.0 and later can share a single Application Gateway with other Azure components. For instance, we could use the same Application Gateway for an app hosted on Virtual Machine Scale Set as well as an AKS cluster.

## Private Address Ranges
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned several address ranges to be used by private networks.

Address ranges to be use by private networks are:  

Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255  
Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255  
Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255  
An IP address within these ranges is therefore considered non-routable, as it is not unique. Any private network that needs to use IP addresses internally can use any address within these ranges without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry. Addresses within this private address space are only unique within a given private network.

All addresses outside these ranges are considered public.

## Cross-tenant / Cross-subscription virtual network peering

Our second scenario is a bit more complex, the configuration is still pretty much the same. This time we have two Azure subscriptions associated with two different Azure AD tenants and two different Service Principals with Multi-tenancy enabled.

## Can I use a managed identity to access a resource in a different directory/tenant? 
No. Managed identities don't currently support cross-directory scenarios.

## If my peered VNets are deployed in different subscriptions, will connectivity via Bastion work?
Yes, connectivity via Bastion will continue to work for peered VNets across different subscription for a single Tenant. Subscriptions across two different Tenants aren't supported. To see Bastion in the Connect drop down menu, the user must select the subs they have access to in Subscription > global subscription.

## I have access to the peered VNet, but I can't see the VM deployed there.
Make sure the user has read access to both the VM, and the peered VNet.

## Can I still deploy multiple Bastion hosts across peered virtual networks?
Yes. By default, a user sees the Bastion host that is deployed in the same virtual network in which VM resides. However, in the Connect menu, a user can see multiple Bastion hosts detected across peered networks. They can select the Bastion host that they prefer to use to connect to the VM deployed in the virtual network.

## Destination limitations for Diagnostic Settings
Any destinations for the diagnostic setting must be created before you create the diagnostic settings. The destination doesn't have to be in the same subscription as the resource sending logs if the user who configures the setting has appropriate Azure role-based access control access to both subscriptions. By using Azure Lighthouse, it's also possible to have diagnostic settings sent to a workspace, storage account, or event hub in another Azure Active Directory tenant.
